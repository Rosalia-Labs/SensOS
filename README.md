# SensOS

**SensOS** is an operating system overlay designed to orchestrate fleets of Raspberry Pi computers.  
It was originally developed by [Rosalia Labs, LLC](https://rosalialabs.com) to support applications in environmental sensing and biodiversity monitoring, where robust, scalable deployments of low-power computing are essential.

If SensOS informs your work, please cite the project and acknowledge contributors.

## Purpose

SensOS extends the [Raspberry Pi OS build framework](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen) with additional stages and tooling for:

- Coordinated deployment of multiple Raspberry Pi devices
- Streamlined configuration for field and laboratory environments
- Support for applications in ecological research, conservation, and sensing networks

Although created for environmental monitoring, SensOS is a general-purpose system overlay and may be useful in other distributed or embedded computing contexts.

## Goals

- **Reliable orchestration** of Raspberry Pi devices at scale
- **Reproducible builds** with minimal manual configuration
- **Extensibility** for custom sensing and data workflows
- **Accessibility** for researchers, practitioners, and developers

## Getting Started

The simplest way to begin is by reviewing the documentation and following the workflow for generating a bootable image.  
Step-by-step guides and usage examples are provided in the [project wiki](./wiki) (or documentation site, if separate).

## Contributing

SensOS is open to contributions. We welcome:

- Improvements to documentation and tooling
- Extensions for new sensing hardware
- Feedback from real-world deployments

If you are interested in contributing, please open an issue or submit a pull request. For major changes, we encourage discussing ideas in advance to ensure alignment.

SensOS is an OS overlay for orchestrating raspberry pi computers. It was developed for applications in environmental sensing. The code is copyright Rosalia Labs, LLC.

# Basic instructions

To create a bootable image for the pi, there are several commands.

`generate-config.sh` creates a `config` file and places it in the `pi-gen` directory. `pi-gen` is the raspberry pi OS framework for creating boot images.
SensOS is an overlay that adds and addtional stage of construction. The `config` file is part of `pi-gen`, so you can find its documentation there.

```
 ./bin/generate-config.sh --help
Usage: ./bin/generate-config.sh [options]

Options:
  --pi-gen-release <value>                   (default: SensOS reference)
  --pigen-docker-opts <value>                (default: -v /Users/keittth/Desktop/SensOS/client/sensos:/sensos)
  --stage-list <value>                       (default: stage0 stage1 stage2)
  --img-name <value>                         (default: sensos)
  --timezone-default <value>                 (default: UTC)
  --keyboard-keymap <value>                  (default: us)
  --keyboard-layout <value>                  (default: English (US))
  --locale-default <value>                   (default: C.UTF-8)
  --first-user-name <value>                  (default: sensos)
  --first-user-pass <value>                  (default: sensos)
  --disable-first-boot-user-rename <0|1>     (default: 1)
  --wpa-country <value>                      (default: US)
  --deploy-compression <value>               (default: none)
  --enable-wifi-ap                           Enable AP (default: disabled)
  --enable-geekworm-eeprom                   Enable EEPROM update (default: disabled)
  --image-size <value>                       (default: 8192 MB)
  --help                                     Display this help message
```

Once the `config` file is generated, call `create-boot-image.sh` to run `pi-gen`.

```
./bin/create-boot-image.sh --help
Usage: ./bin/create-boot-image.sh [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --remove-existing-images       Delete the 'deploy' directory before building
  --build-docker-images          Build and store docker images for offline use
  --continue                     Continue from a previously interrupted build
  -h, --help                     Show this help message a
```

You can use `burn-boot-image.sh` or any other software to copy the resulting image onto an SD card or other bootable media.
