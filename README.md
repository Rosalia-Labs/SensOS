# SensOS

**SensOS** is an operating system overlay designed to orchestrate fleets of Raspberry Pi computers.  
It was originally developed by [Rosalia Labs, LLC](https://rosalialabs.com) to support applications in environmental sensing and biodiversity monitoring, where robust, scalable deployments of low-power computing are essential.

If SensOS informs your work, please cite the project and acknowledge contributors.

## Purpose

SensOS extends the [Raspberry Pi OS build framework](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen) with additional stages and tooling for:

- Coordinated deployment of multiple Raspberry Pi devices
- Streamlined configuration for field and laboratory environments
- Support for applications in ecological research, conservation, and sensing networks

Although created for environmental monitoring, SensOS is a general-purpose system overlay and may be useful in other distributed or embedded computing contexts.

## Goals

- **Reliable orchestration** of Raspberry Pi devices at scale
- **Reproducible builds** with minimal manual configuration
- **Extensibility** for custom sensing and data workflows
- **Accessibility** for researchers, practitioners, and developers

## Getting Started

The simplest way to begin is by reviewing the documentation and following the workflow for generating a bootable image.  
Step-by-step guides and usage examples are provided in the [project wiki](./wiki) (or documentation site, if separate).

## Contributing

SensOS is open to contributions. We welcome:

- Improvements to documentation and tooling
- Extensions for new sensing hardware
- Feedback from real-world deployments

If you are interested in contributing, please open an issue or submit a pull request. For major changes, we encourage discussing ideas in advance to ensure alignment.
