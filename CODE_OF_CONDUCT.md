# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We want SensOS to be a welcoming, respectful, and collaborative project.  
As contributors and maintainers, we pledge to foster an open and harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of background or identity.

## Our Standards

Examples of positive behavior include:
- Using respectful and inclusive language
- Offering constructive feedback
- Being mindful of different experience levels
- Helping create a supportive environment

Unacceptable behavior includes:
- Harassment, insults, or personal attacks
- Trolling or deliberately disruptive comments
- Public or private harassment of any kind

## Intellectual Honesty & Attribution

We value open collaboration and respectful reuse. To keep SensOS a professional community:

- **Credit where due.** Cite SensOS and individual contributors when using code, configurations, or design patterns derived from this project.
- **No passing off.** Do not present unmerged concepts, documentation, or experimental branches from this repo as your own work elsewhere.
- **Respect the license.** Reuse must comply with the LICENSE, including preservation of copyright notices and attribution.
- **Ask for clarity.** If you’re unsure whether reuse is appropriate (especially for non‑code assets like docs, diagrams, deployment playbooks), open an issue to discuss first.
- **Disclose conflicts.** If you plan to use SensOS ideas in a separate or competing project, disclose that intent when contributing or opening issues.

Behavior that undermines these norms may result in limited participation or other appropriate actions by the maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the maintainers at **info@rosalialabs.com**.  
All reports will be reviewed and addressed appropriately.  

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1.
